# Tg-verify

## Now when Telegram is growing at a fast pace, and having more that 500 Million downloads worldwide, most internet users would have it.

## Well, I had an idea that we can use this existing *free* technology to send verification links or one time passwords. Just like how telegram sent us the verification codes.

## If Verification is free then developers are more likely to put it, hence making the web more secure!! 

## Please Contribute, I don't know much about telegram bot API, so help is needed
